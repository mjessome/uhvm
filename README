uhvm v0.2

What is it?
===========
uhvm is a lightweight volume manager for GNU/Linux.
It is an extension on skvm from the Suckless group (http://suckless.org), that
makes constant use of the UUID of devices, and adds support for hooks.
It depends on hal and dbus. It is meant to be simple to use, efficient & 
functional. It has been tested and working on Arch linux, however 
the init script needs to be adapted when used on Debian.

Warning
=======
Make sure you back up your /etc/fstab.

Installation
============
* make
* make install

* Do not forget to alter your /etc/rc.conf to include 'uhvm' in the
  DAEMONS section. If you are using Arch linux use the supplied PKGBUILD
  for a clean installation.

How to use it
=============
* sudo /etc/rc.d/uhvm start
* sudo /etc/rc.d/uhvm restart
* sudo /etc/rc.d/uhvm stop

Info
====
To unmount a drive, you do not have to be root. If you cold eject a drive, uhvm 
will unmount it and delete the mountpoint.
That is probably not a good idea.
